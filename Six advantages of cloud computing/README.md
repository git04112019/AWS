### Advantages of cloud computing

##### From Amazon Whitepapers

* **Trade Capital expense for variable expense** - no longer have to heavily invest in data centers and servers before knowing how much you'll use them.
You pay only for when you consume computing resources and only for how much you consume.

* **Benefit from massive economies of scale** - you can achieve a lower variable cost than you get by your own by using cloud computing.
Usage from hundreds to thousands of customers is aggregated, so providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale

* **Capacity** - eliminate guessing on infrastructure capacity needs. you can access as much or as little capacity as needed, and scale 
up with only a few minutes notice.

* **Increased speed and agility** - new IT resources are a click away, or already automated. 

* **No spending money running and maintaining data centers** - focus shifts away from infrastructure (this coincides with many of the points above) 

* **Global capabilities** - easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world in minutes. 
This means lower latency and better experience for customers around the world
