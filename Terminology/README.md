### Basic Terminology

**Elastic Book Store (EBS)** - provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure

**Relational Database Service (RDS)** - web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Offers access to many varieties of relational database management systems (MySql, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and I'm sure there are more)
