elasticache

essentials:
	elasticache is a fully managed, in memory cache engine

	it is used to improve db performance by caching results of queries that are made to a db

	elasticache is great for large, high performance or high taxing queries - and can store them insdie of a cache (elasticache cluster) that can be accessed later (instead of repeat requests continually hitting the primary db)

	it reduces the load on the database which increases performance

	elasticache allows for managing web sessions and also caching dynamic generated data


	available engines to power elasticache include:
		memached (mem-cache-d)
		redis

	generally, the application needs to be built to work with either redis or memcached

	popular options like mysql have memcached plugins which allow an application to easily work with elasticache (if using memcached as the engine)
