swf

simple workflow

essentials:

	swf is a fully-managed 'work flow' service provided by aws

	a swf workflow allows an architect/developer to implement distributed, asynchronouse applications as a workflow

	a workflow coordinates and manages the execution of activites that can be run asynchronously across multiple computing devices

	swf has consistent execution

	guarantees the order in which tasks are executed

	there are no duplicate tasks

	the swf service is primarily an API which an application can integrate its work flow service into. this allows the service to be used by non-aws services, such as an on-premise data center

	a workflow execution can last up to 1 year


components:

	workflow
		a sequence of steps required to perform a task
		iti s also commonly referred to as a decider

	activities
		a single step (or unit of work) in the workflow

	tasks
		what interacts with the 'workers' that are part of the workflow
		activity task
			tells the worker to perform a function
		decision task
			tells the decier the state of the workflow execution, which allows the decider to determine the next activity to be performed
	worker
		responsible for receiving a task and taking action on it. can be any type of component such as an ec2 instance or even a person
