sns

essentials:
	
	sns coordinates and manages the sending and delivery of message to specific endpoints.

	we are able to use sns to receive notifications when events occur in our aws environment

	sns is integrated into many aws services so it is very easy to set up notifications based on events that occur in those services

	with cloudwatch and sns, a full environment monitoring solution can be created that notifies administrators of alerts, capacity issues, downtime, changes in the environment, and more

	this service can also be used for publishing ios/android app notifications and creating automation based off notifications

components:
