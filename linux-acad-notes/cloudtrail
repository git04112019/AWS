cloudtrail

essentials:
	
	cloudtrail is an api logging service that logs ALL api calls made to aws

	it does not matter if the api calls from the command line, sdk, or console

	all created logs are placed into a designated s3 bucket - so they are highly available by default

	cloudtrail logs help when addressing security concerns by allowing you to view what actions users on your aws account have performed

	since aws is just one big api  - cloudtrail can log every single action taken in your account
