dynamo db

essentials:

	fully managed, noSql db service

	similar to mongoDB but is homegrown aws

	schemaless, and uses a key-value store

	you specify the required throughput capacity, and dynamoDB does the rest (being fully managed)

	being fully managed means:
		service manages all provisioning (and scaling) of underlying hardware

		fully distributed and scales automatically with demand and growth

		built as a fault tolerant highly available service
			on the back end, it fully synchronizes the data across all of the azs within the region you created the dynamo db tables in

	dynamoDb can also easily integrate with other aws services, such as emr
		can easily move data to a hadoop cluster in emr

	popular use cases include:
		iot (storing meta data)
		gaming (storing session information, leaderboards)
		mobile (storing user profiles, personalization)
