lambda

essentials:
	lambda is a 'serverless' computing platform

	serverless means that you can run code without provisioning or managing servers
		so if you want ot run code, you don't have to spin up an ec2 instance and install software, you can just create a 'lambda function,' drop your code in it, and execute it

	lambda scales the required compute power automatically with your code

	you pay only for the compute time that you consume (to the ms)

	by default, it is highly available, fault-tolerant, scalable, elastic, and cost-efficient

	lambda integrates with many other aws services

	currently supported languages:
		node.js
		java
		c#
		python


why use lambda over ec2?
	generally you want to use lambda when you want to run code that is in response to events, such as:
		changes to s3 buckets
		updates to an amazon dynamoDB table
		custom events generated by your applications or devices
