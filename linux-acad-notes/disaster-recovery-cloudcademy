disaster recovery

recovery time objective (RTO) - how much time it will take to get back online after a disruption

recovery point objective (RPO) - how many hours of lost data that you have. for instance, if down at 2pm and the RPO is 2 hours, then you should have all data from noon back.


back up / restore

considerations:
	retention time for media
	security of archives
	recovery/restoration of system

pilot light:
	ec2 instances ready i guess? idk
