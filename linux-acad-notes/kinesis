kinesis

essentials:
	kinesis is a real-time data processing service that continuously captures (and stores) large amounts of data that can power real-time streaming dashboards

	using the aws provided SDKs, you can create real-time dashboards, integrate dynamic pricing strategies, and export data from Kinesis to other aws services

	including:
		emr (analytics)
		s3 (storage)
		redshift (big data)
		lambda (event driven actions)

	components:
		stream
		producers (data creators)
		consumers (data consumers)
		shards (processing power)


benefits:
	real time processing:
		continuously collect and build applications that analyze the data as it is generated

	parallel processing:
		multiple kinesis applications can be processing the same incoming data streaming concurrently

	durable:
		kinesis synchronously replicates the streaming data across three data centers within a single aws region and preserves the data for up to 24 hours

	scales:
		can stream from as little as a few megabytes to several terabytes per hour


when to use:
	gaming:
		collect gaming data such as player actions and feed the data into the gaming platform,f or exp a reactive environment based off of realtime actions of the player

	real-time analytics:
		collect iot sensors from many sources and high amounts of frequency and process it using kinesis to gain insights as data arrives in your environment

	application alerts:
		build a kinesis application that monitors incoming application logs in real-time and trigger events based off the data

	mobile data capture:
		mobile applications can push data to kinesis from countless number of devices which makes the data available as soon as it is produced


kinesis producers:
	producers are devices that collect data for kinesis processing
	you build producers to continuously input data into a kinesis stream
	producers can include:
		IoT sensors
		mobile devices
	you can have literally thousands of different producers and scale based on need:
		the more data you want to process, the more 'shards' you add to your kinesis stream
		each 'shard' can process 2mb of read data per second, and 1mb of write data per second
		

kinesis consumers:
	consumers consume the stream's data
	this is done concurrently (multiple consumers can consume the same data at the same time)
	consumers include (but not limited to):
		real time dashboards
		s3
		redshift
		emr
	any application can consume the stream's data

	kinesis keeps 24 hours of streaming data stored by default, but can be configured to store up to 7 days
