route 53

essentials:
	domain management service (dns hosting service) provided by aws

	key features include:
		domain registration
			register domain names, such as orionpapers.com
		domain name system (dns) service
			translates friendly domains names into ip addresses
			route 53 responds to dns queries using a global network of authoritative DNS servers, which reduces latency
		health checking
			route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to your application to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional

	can manage external dns for domain routing - routing request for some website to the proper aws resources such as cloudfront, elb, ec2, or rds

	commonly used with an elb to direct traffic from the domain to the elb (and thus have traffic evenly distributed)

	can be used to manage internal dns for custom internal hostnames within a vpc as long as the vpc is configured for it

	latency, geo, basic, and failover routing policies allow for region-to-region fault tolerant architecture design

	can easily configure for failover to S3 or cloudfront 


route 53 hosted zones:
	hosted zones stores dns records for your domain

	basically, it contains all the rules (record sets) that tells route 53 what to do with a dns request

	there are both public and private hosted zones:

	public hosted zone: a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as linuxacademy.com, and its subdomains

	private hosted zone: a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more amazon vpcs

	after you create a hosted zone for your domain, you create resource record sets to tell the DNS how you want traffic to be routed for that domain

	hosted zones come pre-populated with NS (name server) and SOA (start of authority) record sets


route 53 record sets:
	record sets are indstructions that actually match domain names to ip addresses
	record sets are comprised of various options, including:
		record type
		standard/alias
		routing policy
		evaluate target health

	common record types include:
	A: used to point to a domain to an ipv4 ip
	AAAA: used to point to a domain of an ipv6
	CNAME: used to point to a host/name to another host/name
	MX: used to route email (mail exchange)

routing policy:
	simple: route all traffic to one endpoint
	weighted: route traffic to multiple endpoints (manual load balancing)
	latency: route traffic to an endpoint based o nthe users latency to various endpoints
	failover: route traffic to a 'secondary' endpoint if the 'primary' is unavailable
	geolocation: route traffic to an endpoint based on the geographical location of the user

evaluate health policy:
	can monitor the health of your application and trigger an action


S3 DNS failover
	s3 bucket can be used as a failover endpoint. 
	this can provide an extremely reliable backup solution if your primary endpoint fails
	bucket name and website name must be exactly the same
