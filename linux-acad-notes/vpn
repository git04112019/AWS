vpn

essentials:

	virtual private network enables the ability to extend a subnet from one geographic location to another geographic location on two separate networks

	extending the subnets allows the network at location 'a' to communicate internally with all resources at location 'b'

	essentially, you are 'extending' the on-premise network to the cloud, or the cloud to the on-premise network


	for aws, this allows us to communicate with all resources (like an ec2 instance) internally without the need for a public ip address and igw

	it also provides an additional level of security by ensuring that traffic sent using the vpn is encrypted

	vpn connection has two parallel routes (IPSec tunnels), which is for redundancy

	only one virtual private gateway can be attached to a vpc (just like one igw)

	a vpc can have both a vpg and an igw attached at the same time


customer gateway:
	
	a physical device or software application at the on-premise location that acts as the 'connector' to the vpn connection

	in your aws acct, the customer gateway component is where you configure the public IP address of the physical device or software application at the on-premise location

	note: both a vpg and a customer gateway are required to establish a vpn connection


virtual private gateway:

	acts as the 'connector' on the vpc (aws) side of the vpn connection.

	the vpg is connected to the vpc.

	note: both a vpg and a customer gateway are required to establish a vpn connection


vpn connection:
	
	the vpn connection is the actual link between the vpg and the customer gateway. 
	the connection is set up and managed by aws
	each connection uses two IPSec tunnels for redundancy


router

	aws has dispensed with the concept of having users physically set up and manage a router. however, it is important to understand that route tables are actually part of a 'router' assigned to your vpc

	when setting up a vpn, the route table (for the subnet you wish to extend to) must include routes for the on-premise network that are used by the vpn, and point them to the virtual private gateway
